## üìä What is the Dividend Discount Model?

The Dividend Discount Model is a method of valuing a company's stock price based on the theory that its stock is worth the sum of all of its future dividend payments, discounted back to their present value. This tool implements a 5-year DDM with:

- **Short-term Growth**: Based on ROE √ó (1 - Payout Ratio)
- **Long-term Growth**: Default 3.5% (adjustable)
- **Cost of Equity**: Calculated using CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model)
- **Terminal Value**: Perpetuity calculation for post-5-year cash flows
